#+title: TODOs (which I'll never do)
#+startup: fold

* Actions
** TODO IPs
+ [ ] Ignore broadcast and localhost
+ [ ] Reverse DNS lookup
+ [ ] whois
+ [ ] Check online DBs
+ [ ] nmap (when aggressive)
** TODO Phone number
+ [ ] Check online DBs (numlookup or zlookup) for owner and carrier
+ [ ] Check online DBs for potential scams
** TODO email
- [X] Check for spam
** TODO URIs
There is /a lot/ to do here. Just to get started I'll cover the basics
- [ ] whois
- [ ] Header info (like =curl -I=)
- [ ] Shodan
- [ ] Check URI on VT
- [ ] open ports
** TODO File path
If it exsits, do some stuff. Obviously, there's a lot of more to do
once the =file= type is detected, but that's for later.
- [ ] If content is not raw bytes run the function recursively on it
- [ ] Check file hash on VT
- [ ] Run analysis on files in directories recursively
- [ ] Check for file carving
*** TODO Photos
- [ ] Check metadata (=exiftools=) and print interesting stuff like
  location, camera info, or software info (i.e. photoshop, gimp, etc)
** TODO Hash
- [ ] Check online databases
*** 
* General
- [ ] Add logging
- [ ] Clipboard flag
- [ ] Run it recursively (maybe in parallel?) to keep checking for more possibilities 

* Implementation notes
- [X] enum type for all these types
- [ ] Regex to match most of these
- [ ] Trait for the =Thing= type
- [ ] Look into doing the tasks in parallel
- [ ] Use nix flake to have all dependencies ready
- [ ] Use github actions to either =nix bundle= or build a docker image
- [ ] Use modules, you brainlet idiot
